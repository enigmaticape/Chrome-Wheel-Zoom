Chrome Wheel Zoom
=
Simple base for a Chrome browser extension that enables mouse wheel zooming in Chrome.

NB Currently, this will disable middle click auto scrolling and opening links in new tabs via the middle click, otherwise it just gets confusing.

Installation in Chrome
-
Download the .crx file, open Chrome, from the main menu select Tools > Extensions. Drag the .crx file onto the extensions window.

Usage
-
Middle click enters/leaves wheel zoom, so middle click with the wheel and then zoom away. Middle click again when you're done.

Todo
-
Options, some indication of mode, possibly storage of settings for domains (although see later), that sort of thing.

Why ?
-
Once upon a time there was a Firefox extension which did something similar. It was a huge help to a VI geek like me. Then FF started to break extensions, and it stopped working.

So I switched to Chrome, because there was a similar extension.  Recently it has started to do some messed up stuff, mainly related, I think, to the way it stores preferences for pages and domains.

So, this.  The simplest thing that could possibly work.
